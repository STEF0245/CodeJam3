# CodeJam3
 This is my Discord math bot for codejam3 of Koder's support server.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
You need to clone/copy this repository and just create a ".env" file.

Add "TOKEN=<your bot token>" in the ".env" file (nothing else no spaces nor characters). 

Then run "npm install discord.js dotenv mathjs", wait a few seconds.

And run "node bot.js"

It should respond with "Logged in as <your bot name>".
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Then you can go to Discord and send "!calc 2+2/2".

The bot should respond with "Result: 3"

You will also see "Received message: !calc 2+2/2, Evaluating expression: 2+2/2, Sending result: 3" in your terminal.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
These are examples ("a" and "b" are random numbers).

It can do many things like:
- Addition [a+b]
- Subtraction [a-b]
- Multiplication [a*b]
- Division [a/b]
- Cosine [cos(a)]
- Sine [sin(a)]
- Tangent [tan(a)]
- Logarithm [log(a)]
- Exponential function [a^b]
- Square root [sqrt(a)]
- Factorial [a!]
- Round up [ceil(a)]
- Round down [floor(a)]
- Round [round(a)]
- Greatest common divisor [gcd(a,b)]
- Least common multiple [lcm(a,b)]
- Arccosine [acos(a)]
- Arcsine [asin(a)]
- Arctangent [atan(a)]
- Hyperbolic cosine [cosh(a)]
- Hyperbolic sine [sinh(a)]
- Hyperbolic tangent [tanh(a)]
- Error function [erf(a)]
